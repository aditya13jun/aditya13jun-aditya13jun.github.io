        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        Butter chicken is cooked in a traditional clay oven or tandoor. Its first marinated in a mix of spices including
        cumin, turmeric, garlic and ginger, along with yogurt and lemon juice. A tomato sauce with butter and cream is
        then poured over it. Time and experimentation have inspired many different versions of the recipe which can be
        found online, many using a variety of different spices.
        What you get here is two recipes in one—a traditional tandoori chicken with an added makhani (or butter gravy).
        The recipe originally made at the Moti Mahal used fewer spices than many of the versions you see today.The story
        of how butter chicken came to be invented is almost as interesting as the dish itself. The Moti Mahal, in
        pre-partition days, was a restaurant in Peshawar founded by Mokha Singh Lamba. Both Kundan Lal Gujral and Kundan
        Lal Jaggi worked there as servers for some years. Thakur Dass was at his familys rice and pulses wholesale
        business just across the road from the restaurant.

        The Moti Mahal shut down just before partition. During these difficult times, many refugees moved to areas of
        India because of partition, bringing their various skills and culture with them. Peshawar cuisine was soon to
        find a new home in Delhi when the chance came to revive the original Moti Mahal in the capital territory. Mokha
        Singh Lamba, although he was then too old to continue running the restaurant, was happy for the three
        entrepreneurs to use the original logo and gave his full blessing to the enterprise.

        With a growing population of Punjabis in the region, there was a ready-made legion of potential customers who
        wanted to eat traditional Peshawar fare. The trio began by selling breads and tea but then purchased three
        tandoors and began serving fish and chicken too.

        Theres no doubt that the trials and tribulations that partition created also forged a strong bond between the
        three entrepreneurs. They wanted the restaurant to work and, though it took a lot of hard work with their wives
        earning extra money sewing, the intrepid entrepreneurs put their heart and soul into the project. They finally
        found a shop in Daryaganj in 1947 and raised the funds they needed to start their tea room. As the business
        began to grow, their fame did too. And the innovations started to come. Cooking tandoori dishes, they were
        presented with a problem—left hanging, the tandoori dried out and, not wanting to waste anything, the team were
        searching for a way to make the chicken more moist.The simple answer came when a Bengali customer came to the
        restaurant and tried to order a simple chicken curry. There was only tandoori, but the chef was guided to make a
        gravy to go with the dish. This initially consisted of cream, butter and tomatoes with a few spices. When they
        realized that this was the perfect way to rehydrate dry tandoori, butter chicken was born and, from then on,
        became one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine.

        Up until partition, the main cooking in Delhi was vegetarian because the majority of the population was Hindu.
        Gradually, however, chicken was introduced, and Peshawar cuisine became a norm as the demographics changed with
        the influx of new people and influences. Theres no doubt that this meeting of different cultures led to changes
        in menus. Butter chicken wasnt the only example. Soon there was buttered dahl too, and by the 1950s, Delhi had
        become the center of cooking and innovation in India.

        The Moti Mahal also became one of Delhi most respected and visited restaurants. It hosted some famous names
        during the 50s, 60s and 70s. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev ate there, as well as American president Richard
        Nixon. Jackie Kennedy famously dined with JFK, and even the Queen of England paid a visit. Khrushchev used to
        send out to the restaurant for official events and that led to the opening of a restaurant in Moscow in 1963.

        From one restaurant in Daryaganj, the Moti Mahal became a global brand with restaurants from Uttar Pradesh to
        New Zealand, Saudi Arabia to Tanzania. It is still one of the most recognized names in Indian cuisine.Since it
        was first created back in the 1950s, butter chicken has traversed the globe. You can find it in practically
        every town and city where there is an Indian restaurant. Go online, and youll discover several hundred different
        reincarnations of the original recipe, some by the most famous chefs in the world today.

        At its heart, though, butter chicken is a simple dish. The combination of a tandoori chicken with a creamy and
        slightly spicy tomato sauce is mouth-watering. While other, more complex recipes may catch your eye every now
        and again, the home-cooked, comfort food that butter chicken defines is always going to be a winner.

        While the trio of entrepreneurs has since left us, their influence on Indian cuisine and Delhi as a center of
        culinary excellence remains. They are, perhaps more than any other group of people, responsible for helping to
        internationalize Indian cookery and put new recipes like butter chicken on the map.

        Since it was first created back in the 1950s, butter chicken has traversed the globe. you can find it in
        practically every town and city where there is an Indian restaurant. <br>

        <h3>Beef</h3>
        Each individual in America has a goal he or she wants to accomplish. Whether its to purchase a new car or a
        huge home, its a goal wanted to be reached. However with the amount of fast food that Americans eat today, they
        will have a hard time accomplishing these goals because of the obesity or even disease theyll have from the
        fast food. One major fast food that we like to eat while on the go is hamburgers. If its breakfast we grab a
        burger, if its lunch we grab a burger and even when its dinner we will grab a burger and might throw in some
        fires and a huge soda to go with it. Hamburgers are one of the leading causes of obesity and disease catching
        food.

        In the Bio Analogics article it states that nearly two-thirds of residents of United States are overweight, and
        since 1991 the incidence of obesity has risen from 12 percent to more than 25 percent. This is due to the amount
        of junk food and burgers, we ate daily. To see if I am also one of these fast food consuming eaters, I composed
        a diary of what I eat daily and I discovered that within my weekly schedule, thats between school and work- I
        eat hamburgers at least three times a week. I ate these burgers not just from one place, I ate them from four
        different places. The first one I ate was at In-and-Out. The second one was at Fuddruckers. The fourth day I had
        one in McDonalds and on the sixth day in which my friends and I went to Applebees after work and I still had
        the nerve to order a hamburger even when there were other items on the menu.

        Hamburgers come from ground beef, which in reality if you consume a couple of hamburgers per month, it wont
        harm you, but it states in ConsumerReports.org, “Americans show their affection for ground beef and burgers by
        consuming approximately 30 pounds of ground beef per person per year. Ground beef's saturated fat can contribute
        to heart disease, and the bacteria it sometimes harbors can sicken or kill someone who eats beef that is not
        cooked thoroughly.” With this information available to Americans daily, we still do consume the ground beef and
        even have the nerve to tell ourselves and our friends that we plan to cut back on it any day now. <br>

        <h3>Sushi</h3>
        Sushi had been introduced to the West by the early 1900s, following Japanese immigration after the Meiji
        Restoration. However, it was not popular among anyone except the upper-class, and as Japanese immigration
        declined in the late 1900s, it became much less common.
        Sushi began becoming more popular again in the United States a few years after the conclusion of World War II,
        when Japan once again became open for international trade, tourism, and business. In the 1960s, this trend began
        to take hold in America in earnest, and middle-class Americans began trying sushi for themselves and loving it.
        Like most elements of food history, there is a great deal of debate surrounding exactly which restaurant
        introduced sushi to Western Diners and its really not possible to determine exactly who was responsible for
        doing so.
        However, Kawafuku Restaurant of Los Angeles is often credited with this honor as it was one of the first
        restaurants to offer sushi. As you can imagine, though, the idea of eating raw fish took a little while to catch
        on in America but by the late 1960s, sushi had become trendy, and new sushi restaurants were opening up all
        across the country.
        To help Americans get used to the idea of eating sushi, many restaurants began experimenting with new taste
        combinations and sushi rolls. One of the rolls that became the most popular among Americans was the
        now-ubiquitous California Roll, which is an inside-out “makizushi” roll with cucumber, crab meat (or imitation
        crab meat), and avocado with white rice.
        This flavor combination was instantly appealing to diners and because the crab meat was cooked in the roll,
        diners didnt have to be squeamish about eating raw fish and as they got used to the idea, they were able to
        branch out into more traditional sashimi and nigiri dishes. Just like that, sushi restaurants became a national
        phenomenon.Whether you like it raw, sashimi-style, flash-fried as part of a sushi roll, or chopped up in a
        Poke-style sushi bowl, eating raw fish no longer frowned upon in the US and just about everyone has tried sushi
        at some point.
        Whether you pair it with a glass of sake, a cocktail, a glass of wine, or any other beverage, sushi offers a
        unique and flavorful eating experience thats unlike anything else. The cold, firm fish combined with rice,
        sauce, and other ingredients is truly one-of-a-kind and delicious.
        Sushi has quickly become one of the most popular international dishes over the last century or so, and its easy
        to find a sushi restaurant anywhere in the world especially in the United States, where there are over 4,000
        sushi restaurants. But how did this delicious dish get its start, and become so popular in America? Was the idea
        of eating raw fish always accepted among the populace? Who is responsible for the popularity of sushi?
        Get the answers to all of these questions and more by reading this article. We will give you a brief history of
        sushi around the world and in the US, and discuss why its so popular today. Grab a glass of sake and a piece of
        sashimi and read on to get all of the details. <br>
